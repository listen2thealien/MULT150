Improving The Game:

1. The game is relatively simple, I think it has a normal amount of difficulty.

2. Adding more Chaos Balls or increasing their speed along with the speed of the colored balls could make the game harder.
   To make the game easier, you could slow down the speed of the balls and increase player movement speed.

3. To give the game more pizazz overall or a "wow" factor you could make enclose the arena, 
   making it very tall and implement zero gravity to both the balls and your character.
   That way, it's like a futuristic game in space.

4. The fun part of the game is when the colored balls fall into their goal and the lights disappear.
   The more tedious or boring part of the game is trying to get the balls in their goals.

Exercise Implementations:

1. Added a Chaos Goal and counter to see how many Chaos Balls you destroyed.
2. Changed length of player's Bumper to be more effective at maneuvering balls into their goals.
3. Switched footsteps audio for water splashing FX.
4. Covered excess water with terrains
5. Added timer

Additional Changes:

+ Repositioned FPS Camera
+ 2 Particle Systems
+ Ducks, King Duck, Goat VIP's
+ 2 spinning signs
+ Fencing
+ Music & Welcome intro
+ Attached spotlight to player (FPSController)
